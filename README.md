# AO3 recommender

This project was done as part of the Data science master of Kschool. The goal of the project is to build a set of recommendation tools that will be able to recommend Marvel fanfictions of the AO3 website. The tools implemented here include a scrapper to download the metadata of the fics that want to be included in the recommender. It also includes tools for recommending fanfics based on a collaborative system based on the likes provided by registered authors and a content based system based on the tags associated to each fic. The programs have been tested with a set of 10,000 users and 121,000 fics from the Marvel fandom. To make the search for interesting fanfics more approachable a dashboard made with dash is also provided.

Details about the project and how to run the different scripts can be found on the project wiki page:
